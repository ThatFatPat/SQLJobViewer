1. Download and install Python 3.7.4.
2. `pip install virtualenv`
4. Run `virtualenv ENV_NAME`
5. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. `wfastcgi-enable`
Note: This will add a few configuration lines to applicationHost.config to allow running FastCGI apps.
7. Create site in IIS
8. In `Feature Delegation`, allow Read/Write access to Handler Mappings to the newly created site.
9. Change authentication method of site from Anonymus to Application Pool Identity.
10. Add Read/Write permissions on the application source folder to the application pool user.
11. Create a web.config. (Follow the example file)
12. Create a settings.json. (Follow the example file)
13. Set permissions on settings.json to only allow access to administrator and the IIS user for the application.
14. Add IIS APPOOL\APPNAME user to SQL Server users database. // If Trusted_connection=yes in connection string
15. Grant permissions to the user such that it can SELECT sys.objects. (The only way I got this to work was by granting sysadmin. There may be other ways)
